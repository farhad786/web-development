 <h3> Full stack web developer </h3>
 <p class="purple-color">2020-present|pro level developer </p>
 <p>I am the master of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I know everything needed to make a website function efficiently. I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with the most popular JavaScript framework called Vue JS. I even know the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution</p>
 <p> They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote web developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
